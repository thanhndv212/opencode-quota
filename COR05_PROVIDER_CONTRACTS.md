# COR-05 provider payload and window contracts

Issue: #12. PR: [#39](https://github.com/thanhndv212/opencode-quota/pull/39). Branch: `fix/cor-05-provider-contracts`. Status: implementation and local validation; hosted CI/merge pending. Reviewed 2026-10-08.

## Provenance and adaptation

The Copilot port uses the complete parser/billing implementation at `84c2a330b9b741392dfbd4635f3f0e1dd4c9ce0f`, including these reviewed changes:

- `5d7d435fb197722511ff1b5b456982dd55883d03`: AI Credit reports, explicit legacy billing selection and plan-only placeholders.
- `7e6d26d1f8618b2e225a41de264683c4327a0cea`: validated GHE.com routing bound to the selected credential.
- `98b2aedf205bfa278bc894be4e907a4cdea8cc49`: complete-response timeout, already adapted in COR-01.
- `25d05ce892eaffdf1b0ce9536696668c5e50a9b0`: diagnostic/error redaction.
- `5c65696302dc50b3153db7fd5546b219404703f2`: included/billed quantities, dollar amounts and separate budget display.
- `84c2a330b9b741392dfbd4635f3f0e1dd4c9ce0f`: over-limit token-billing snapshots.

OpenAI window classification adapts `3e845de9e7390d1c6d77e66f0ab2f45fc5615702`. Anthropic 401/re-auth/429 coverage is already delivered by COR-03 / PR #38, merged at `ef00d42`, with green main CI 37803649093 after rerunning an abandoned macOS job.

Fork adaptations preserve the buffering HTTP interface, fresh access-token auth, legacy Copilot payload aliases and deterministic commands. The resolved-auth prepare closure captures the same credential, deployment, billing model, target and UTC month used by its cache identity and fetch. New `copilot-contract-v2` qualifiers prevent reuse of old-format Copilot results without changing shared cache storage. Upstream structured accounting/status-details APIs are deferred to ACC-01; normalized value/percentage rows work through the existing plugin, TUI, CLI and Electron pipeline.

Unlike the source's single-quantity fallback, gross-only credit usage leaves included/billed counts unknown. Partial dollar sums do not become complete billed totals. No plan-name allowance is invented for AI Credits. A reported credit denominator stays separate from a managed dollar budget.

## Local validation

Node 22.23.3 / pnpm 10.0.0: typecheck, 137 Vitest files / 1,437 tests, installed-tarball `build:check`, formatting and `git diff --check` passed. Installed-tarball macOS Electron 42.5.0 startup, six tabs, preload, version and refresh also passed. Provider payloads are fixture-backed. Hosted CI, review, merge and green merged-main CI remain pending.

## Migration and rollback

No config or credential files are rewritten. Existing PAT configs without `billingModel` select AI Credits. Legacy annual Pro/Pro+ reporting requires explicit `legacy_premium_requests`; managed or ineligible tiers cannot use that mode. This changes the endpoint used by existing PAT configs and must be included in release notes. Legacy OAuth payloads remain readable.

Amounts and credits retain distinct units. No database/export schema migration is included. TypeScript consumers must handle optional totals/percentages and the new plan-only result mode. Managed AI Credit usage may make additional quota/billing requests for its applicable dollar budget, with bounded pagination; it never invokes a model. Budget failures retain usage and produce warnings.

Rollback reverts this implementation and restores the prior package/config selection together. Old results remain separated by cache qualifiers. Fixture and installed-package evidence does not certify live GitHub/ChatGPT contracts or actual OpenCode host compatibility.
